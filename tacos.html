            <li>Grill the avocado, about 2-3 minutes per side and transfer to a platter. Grill the corn tortillas for 1-2 minutes to warm them and get some grill marks.</li>

Wrap the warm corn tortillas in a dish towel to keep warm and soft. Serve with queso fresco, salsa verde and pickled onions.</li>
